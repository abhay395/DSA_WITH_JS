# DSA\_WITH\_JS

A JavaScript repository containing **around 80+ Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA)** implementations and practice questions — perfect for developers looking to level up their problem-solving skills using JavaScript.([GitHub][1])

## &#x20;Repository Structure

At the time of the last update, the repo includes the following files and directories:([GitHub][1])

* **Array/**
* **BinaryTree/**
* **LinkedList/**
* **Queue/**
* **Recursion/**
* **SearchingAndSorting/**
* **Stack/**
* **String/**
* **TwoPointerSlidingWindow/**

Each directory is dedicated to a specific category of DSA problems or patterns.

## &#x20;Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhay395/DSA_WITH_JS.git
   cd DSA_WITH_JS
   ```

2. **Explore the folders** to find specific categories:

   * Navigate to directories like `Array/`, `LinkedList/`, `SearchingAndSorting/`, etc.

3. **Run your JavaScript files** to practice implementations using Node.js or any JS runtime.

## What’s Inside

* **Array**: Common operations and problem scenarios using arrays.
* **LinkedList**: Implementation of singly linked lists and related algorithms.
* **Stack / Queue**: LIFO and FIFO structures with sample use cases.
* **BinaryTree**: Tree creation, traversal, and manipulation techniques.
* **SearchingAndSorting**: Implementations of core algorithms like binary search, merge sort, quicksort, and more.
* **Recursion**: Classic recursion examples—factorials, tree traversal, backtracking.
* **String**: String manipulation problems and common JS methodologies.
* **TwoPointerSlidingWindow**: Sliding window and two-pointer pattern strategies.

## Why This Repo Exists

This resource is especially helpful for:

* Practicing DSA in JavaScript for interviews or coding challenges.
* Learning how to structure and apply core algorithmic patterns.
* Reinforcing understanding of data structures tailored to the dynamic nature of JS.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! You can help by:

* Adding new DSA problem implementations.
* Improving documentation or file organization.
* Creating tests to verify code accuracy.
* Enhancing readability with comments or better structure.

When contributing:

* Follow clear naming conventions (e.g., `Graph/`, `DynamicProgramming/`).
* Keep your code clean, well-formatted, and documented.
* Test thoroughly with sample inputs and expected outcomes.

## Suggestions for Users

To make the most of this repository:

* **Pick a topic** (e.g., Arrays, LinkedLists) and solve all related problems.
* **Write your own tests** in JavaScript as you go—this strengthens understanding.
* **Refactor and optimize** your code; explore alternative solutions or edge cases.
* **Track your progress**—perhaps create a spreadsheet or markdown log.
